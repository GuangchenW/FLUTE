Fluorescence Lifetime Ultimate Explorer (FLUTE) provides a graphical user interface to explore fluorescence lifetime data using phasor analysis. The tool allows for quick and interactive analysis of experimental data, and can export results for further processing. 

An example of various analyses can be seen here:

### Built with

FLUTE mainly depends on the following packages:

* [PyQt](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
* [Scipy](https://scipy.org)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org)

With the exe compiled using
```auto-py-to-exe```


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting started

### Running the exe
To quickly start using FLUTE, an exe which works on Windows computers without installing Python is available under releases on the github.

### Running the code
To run the code from this github page, run main.py after installing:

```pip install PyQt5, numpy, opencv-python, matplotlib, scikit-image```

### Prerequisites

Data must be saved as a tiff-stack, where each page of the stack represents a bin in the measurement of the fluorescence decay. Example data is avilable in the supplemental data of the release publication.
